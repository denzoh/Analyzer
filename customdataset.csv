Review,Sentiment
The course is poorly organised: There is a project on week one that requires knowledges of week two. Some concepts are dictated more than once because it uses videos made for this course + other recorded from a class room. I think this course should be a 3 weeks project and the price should be the half of it cost. Though I enjoyed the second project.,Negative
"To be honest, I couldn't realize why this had to be an entire seminar on its own. Apart from",Negative
"Interesting material and good teacher but very poor use of the media (an audio file would have been sufficient for most lectures) and low quality recording for some lectures (background noises, echos, wind...)",Negative
"The quality of the presentation is very low, and way below the quality in other courses.",Negative
"I would suggest to remake the lessons. The speech by the author is very interesting, but the images are a bit poor (and boring) in the sense of not completing to much their explainations.",Negative
poor!,Negative
Very poor in all aspects.,Negative
"No technical staff around to help, only one or two examples of how the math works, and a general poor explanation of the concepts.",Negative
The least comprehensive course I ever took. It needs very good prerequisite about computer vision.,Negative
Very poor course. Not at all academically rigorous. Just a bunch of common sense statements.,Negative
The programming assignments however lack instructions and the online judgement system has some strange requests which are not illustrated in the instruction.,Negative
"Difficult to understand the professor, and slides were hard to read",Negative
I dont like how this course was presented. The professors are good but the way how they present the course is extremely inefficient.,Negative
"the only problem i have with this course and the others in this specialization is that the instructors think we are all employed people, leaders, and we are responsible for a team.",Negative
Learning materials are poorly delivered.,Negative
Extremely poor help and feedback. Almost no replies on discussion forums,Negative
This course needs an easier way to peer review.,Negative
This one was much tougher than the previous two courses.,Negative
It is hard to be constructive when you do have something brilliant to compare with.,Negative
Forums were poorly organized and not well participated in.,Negative

Excellent class design and course delivery!!! I think the assignments can be more difficult and less spoon-feeding.,Positive
Really nice introduction to Machine Learning. It contains essential contents which is not difficult and also not easy.,Positive

Wonderful class. I have been reading this kind of material by myself. This course is by far the greatest one that professor explains difficult concept in a super simply and straight forward way.,Positive

"I think this is a good review for someone who has the basic in English grammar; however, if you're an ESL student or English-speaking person (who need to start over in grammar). Study first before starting this course.",Negative
"Poor visual communications, it should be better since it is the only way to follow the course. Should be nice if the slides counted with a kind of animation to enphatize what we are talking about.",Negative
"All the modules but last are really interesting and informative. The last week's module is very poorly explained, a beginner cannot really understand it",Negative
Poorly designed and explained. You do not really gain much knowledge from this course. I would not recommend my friends and basically others to take this course,Negative
"Really poor course. Rather than starting from the basics, this course picks random information to work with. Week 1 was information anybody with a computer knows.",Negative
very poor content on Java Script. If you just started JS do not take this course. It will be too hard.,Negative

The lectures are fairly light and there are no assignments throughout the course to reinforce the material.,Negative
"An ok introduction to Swift Programming, but I can see people who do not have previous development experience struggling with this course.",Negative
"The videos are poorly done, and it's hard to follow with practicing in a Playground at the same time.",Negative

Nice course. Learnt a lot on topic.,Positive

"The course is not bad, right? It gives you interesting texts to read, right?",Negative
"Not very informative content, some parts are interesting but not worth the money.",Negative
One of the worst courses that I have taken,Negative
"This course is not set up right, the assignments ask you to do things that aren't explained until the next weeks content, its kind of discouraging. In the end, it does teach you the basics of R, its just too bad that the way to get there is aggravating.",Negative
Course does not do a good job actually explaining R or training you on how to properly use it.,Negative
Overall not a bad course.,Negative
I wanted to love this course so bad but unfortunately I couldn't.,Negative

"the course is very good, but in comparison with the first course with dr Leigh Thompson, the instructor in a little bit monotonus,",Negative
